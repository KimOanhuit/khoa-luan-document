2039,1062,-1,1,2,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,My reason for opposing is simply one of time It is my firm belief that an Admin nominee must demonstrate a reasonable amount of contribution to the Wiki quantitatively judged by edit distribution and quanity and qualitatively judged by well examining edits I also believe that a nominee must also demonstrate commitment to the Wiki in terms of time I believe that three months is the absolute minimum and my personal preference is for four to five This is not a statement about the quality of a candidatea candidate that has what it takes to be a good Administrator has those qualities from their very first day on the Wiki and a candidate that does not posess those qualities will not aquire them even in months of contribution to the Wiki I believe that requiring a certain time commitment serves both as an opportunity for the candidate to observe and digest the various elements of the community but also allows the community time to evaluate the candidate Trust but verify Verification requires time That is why I am Opposing I would also like to comment on some elements of your answers that I noted These are my opinions and do not neccessarily reflect the viewpoints of the community as a whole I happen to dislike NSLE's question #3 as I don't neccesarily agree that blocking abusive vandals who have targeted you is a conflict of interest so to me the question itself is problematic My feeling is that if users are vandalising and being uncivil that is problematic no matter if they are attacking you or someone else If you would block them if their actions were directed at another user I have no issue with you blocking them yourself However it's perfectly alright to get a second opinion I just don't feel it's an absolute neccessity Also your answer to NSLE's question #1 seems to discuss taking steps to confirm whether the established editor is really using a sockpuppet or not This is just me being picky about semantics but in my mind the phrasing of the question you find out that an editor has been using sockpuppets abusively Implies the editor is a sockpuppetin other words you are informed as as established fact that an editor is abusing sockpuppets I'd be interested to see what your response was with that interpretation I do however like your answers to a lot of the other questions and I thank you for your work with Tawkerbot2the more tools we have to fight vandalism with the better I think you are on the right path but I feel you need some more time to experience Wikipedia and learn more about the subleties of the culture here Best regards

You totally vetted out an RfA candidate went over a significant sampling of their edits read all the oppose and support rationales and did the homework to draw your own conclusions in a few minutes? There are obviously people far more talented than I am here because it takes me about an hour for even the most uncontroversial candidate Piotrus has his flaws but after reading over everything that has been said in the last couple days I don't feel that he would abuse the tools and that his having them could only be a net positive Everything else is just political posturing and schoolyard grudges

Add to this that these three self-noms in as many months give a distinct impression of chomping at the bit and some impatience and I feel uncomfortable with supporting an RfA now Most editors who succeed here have several months of good reliable editing with usually no substantial errors during that time and certainly not in the last few weeks I'd suggest some patience an accumulation of a reputation for not getting things off-center and a non-self-nom in a couple more months and not a few more weeks I know from myself that it is easy to think you have "seen most things/it all" and then as time goes by you realise just how much you hadn't seen On the up side I see among recent edits non-contentious AfD closures — getting a feel for more things is an excellent continuation -

My view on this is pragmatic I would prefer that people who have made mistakes continue with the project rather than leave or exercise cleanstart So when a candidate stands who chose not to cleanstart from events this old it is important that we don't judge them to a harsher standard than if they had exercised cleanstart and we were just judging their last two years contributions

2364,3371,1,1,1,0,0,8,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,I was going to nominate Cyde myself as in my view he has sound judgment and a good grasp not only of policy but also of the principles which underly policy I believe he will make good and responsible use of admin tools I deferred nominating at Cyde's request due to the userbox war issues I think those should be ignored as a bad period in the community's history during which many people did things which they regretted on reflection and it's still not clear how best to resolve these issues I have no reservations about Cyde I know he can express strong opinions but I do not see that happening in an admin role - we are not required to be plaster saints while acting in our normal capacity as editor although it does of course help if we remember to remain calm

He'd be a wonderful admin" I have seen Neuro's name around a lot lately and have generally had a positive impression of him he is always willing to assume good faith when there isn't especially strong evidence of bad faith and he admits and learns from his past mistakes He is very active in a lot of administrator-heavy areas of the project and is very thoughtful and patient when it comes to dealing with newcomers who don't understand Wikipedia's processes quite yet We need more administrators with these traits and we need more highly active admins That said I feel it would be against Neuro's wishes for somebody to not be honest and forth-right with him and I will not lie I have at times been concerned by Neuro's handling of certain situations There are times when Neuro makes judgmental mistakes and he knows this he's not afraid of owning up to his mistakes and on occasion I find he is a tad too willing to give obviously bad-faith editors more chances than they should have I'm not suggesting that he AGF less often but I just wanted to offer a reminder that sometimes

Off hand in all of Wikipedia I can think of a small handful of extremely exceptional exceptions Some Opposers cite a lack of maturity but all I see are accusations Do I see any blocks in TTSNB's log? Do I see him standing tall before ArbCom for incidents of dickery? Not that I can see Other Opposers state that he hasn't learned from previous RfAs Well he has very clearly said that he is not a content contributor Why is this a sin? Admins are admins They sweep the floors and fix the handrails they don't paint the paintings Some Opposers cite a lack of communication with the community This is more troubling but I couldn't find myself believing that it outweighs the positive Let TTSNB whack vandals Let TTSNB stick to whacking vandals if he wants to branch out into other areas let TTSNB find a mentor to help him/her not "them" shudder and fie learn how to handle the various challenges and interpersonal interactions involved The worst thing I see here is the yapping of The Thing That Should Not Be's friends some of whom need to be whacked with even more vigor &bull

Even if TommyBoy only occasionally uses the tools one new administrator is much more significant to the project than many who slowly starts becoming inactive and stop editing all together

If you ask me this is what we should look for in an admin Anyway long story short it's a pity that this RfA may not pass as MER-C could truly be one of our better admins if we'd give him the chance

365,281,1,7,2,0,0,8,0,0,1,4,3,0,1,1,2,0,0,I take WereSpielChequers' concerns seriously and hope the candidate does too regardless of the result of this RfA But going through the candidate's talk page contributions I see an editor who readily admits when he's made a mistake and who's willing to explain why he took a particular action I consider both of those qualities to be essential in an administrator I'm not at all concerned by the candidate wanting to check a couple of things off his to-do list eg the GA submission before coming here 
5160,1705,-1,0,0,0,0,23,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,2,0,0,Sharkface is a very civil editor and contrary to what some people have said above he does value the project However that value is popping up in the wrong places at the moment Its great to see how he likes to acknowledge the importance of editors on this project and rewards them with a motivating barnstar or two But of course too much of his focus seems to be placed on that and his criteria for awarding needs some revision Also this type of endeavor makes him appear too focused on socializing and not enough time editing I also think he needs a bit more time showing his experience as far as tool wise Admin coaching would probably amend concerns about experience easily though I think there exists good potential in Shakeface to make a good administrator all that is required is that he take what has been said in this section to heart and work off of it

Just not a good feeling here seems like a one-dimensional candidate though apparently good enough in that one dimension I'm not happy to be making an edit in a space I normally don't go with a candidate who I'd previously thought was pretty OK - but there you go

"go away and don't come back until you've touched an article with more than AWB" This is no longer about content edits it wasn't for me when the second RfA came around This is about a user who when faced with community consensus about his behaviour and actions in relation to community trust chooses ignoring it and biding his time as a preferable option to listening Any RfA is based as X! says around the question "do you trust this user as an admin?" and the answer has to be "no" Why? Because an admin has to listen to the community Because an admin has to be able to accept when he's wrong or when his opinions on a block or delete or article protection are different from those of everyone else in the room I have yet to see a shred of evidence that The Thing is capable of that on the contrary as I have shown the only evidence is that he ignores community consensus I do not want an admin who does that I particularly do not want an admin who does that on issues of trust

4748,7820,1,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,14,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,This sounds like a perfect job for a bot Let there be oversight let the problems be worked out let problems with the bots function reflect on its owner let any abuse face severe and immediate consequences and let the damned bot do its job and save us all a bunch of tedious incredibly bot-like work It'll do the job faster without human error and without complaint I have nothing but respect for the people who take care of protecting these things day-in and day-out but I honestly don't see how you can enjoy what seems to me to be such mind-numbing work Let the human admins put in their efforts where the human mind is needed Where we have simple but very repetetive tasks use bots Isn't use of tools to solve problems supposed to be our strong point as a species? As I said oversight is important and should be present these are reasons for caution more than outright opposition in my book 
1123,7820,1,8,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,with some concerns I am in general cautious in giving bot-like tools to admins or admin status to bots unless there is something extreme going on Examples of this include Curps's block bot to catch Willy on Wheels saving us from hours of move-backs and reversion I quite strongly opposed the block-bot of Tawker's Tor-catcher Nonetheless the "protect" tool is a much lighter tool than the "block" tool since any damage done will be mildly annoying rather than outright disruptive to anyone affected a wrongly protected page can be brought to AN a wrongly blocked user may be in a big quandry so my concerns over this bot are much milder Since vandalism affecting main-page articles is particularily nasty since it becomes so high profile I will support this giving this bot the protection button

Some even more incorrect speedy tagging which if it was last month I would say 'oppose' but Chzz has over 4 months and 14000 edits since then and in counter argument although those articles should not have been speedy tagged they should also not have been added in the state they were added in Reahad was not a new user and could have been expected to know better at the time

316,11,-1,2,0,0,0,47,4,8,1,0,0,0,0,10,4,0,0,I remember this user's previous RfA well I opposed without much conviction and sincerely hoped this user would prove me wrong by taking the RfA's failure in a mature way particularly since they spent the entire time vigorously trying to convince the community that they're completely mentally sound level-headed could handle stress without issue That didn't happen Secret declared an indefinite Wikibreak and posted a lengthy statement on their userpage now deleted explaining that they had to recuperate after the RfA and declaring that they probably couldn't handle another one I have tons of respect for this user but judging them with the same standards as I would anyone else I simply don't have complete confidence in their maturity or stability

4809,1951,-1,1,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,WOW! How come so many editors are supporting when this user clearly hasn't been active long enough or racked up wnough experience?! 8 months one of which he was inactive and the others with low edit counts? Under 200 Wikipedia namespace edits?! We really are letting our standards slide significantly However although I don't think the editor is a bad guy or would abuse the tools he really needs more experience I thought I knew everything on here then I started contributing to AfD and noticeboards recently and I found I knew very little I'm only now getting a grasp on things and I've been here over 2 years This user needs waaay more experience and I'll oppose until he does so Please don't reply over and over to this comment everythin's already been said above and you're not going to change my mind so there's no need Cheers

1093,7511,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,cause adminship is no big deal and bias against deletionists is not an acceptable reason for opposing in my opinion 
3371,2284,-1,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,A 30% edit summary usage for major edits is just way too low I wouldn't hesitate to support you in a month once you've gone about fixing this problem but really anyone looking to be an administrator must know that edit summary usage is an important issue and potentially a deal-breaker

Yes duh But does that make him unworthy of adminship? No We shouldn't judge people's character on the subject area of their editing If someone wants to edit political or sexual articles does that automatically deny them adminship? No Sam Spade has has a couple of problems here but who hasn't? I'm not naming names but Sam Spade would make a better admin than some of our current admins He isn't afraid to speak his mind something I feel Wikipedia could use more of and voice his opinion even when he is in the minority Speaking his mind is now being held against him We need more admins but we don't really need more [[Sheep|admins]] It would be nice to have someone who knows the ins and outs of Wikipedia both the editing side and the wikipolitical side be made admin Like I said it seems this bid will fail but I felt I just had to speak my mind

31,4930,1,12,1,0,0,7,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,albeit with some hesitation that I wish were not necessary I object most strongly to the practice of "outing" the real-life identifies of Wikipedians who need or prefer to edit anonymously It is unfortunate that the candidate has made comments that could be read by those who have been victimized by this practice as anything other than joining in that objection Sensitivity to the concerns of fellow Wikipedians and especially for the types of issues that in the past have driven contributors to leave the project is important in any editor and especially in a would-be administrator If I believed there was any significant possibility that the candidate would do anything as an administrator that is inconsistent with our policies in this important area I would find that disqualifying for an admin candidate However upon carefully reviewing all of the candidate's comments I am convinced that he is now sensitized to this issue and has no intention of taking administrator actions that would raise this concern Apart from that important issue I find that the candidate has a strong record in "behind the scenes" work necessary to the maintenance of the encyclopedia and a commitment to helping with some of our most persistent backlogs Despite the hesitation I feel whenever I disagree with many of the esteemed Wikipedians who are opposing on balance I find myself tilting narrowly into the support column Whether or not this RfA succeeds I urge that Gracenotes continue to be mindful of the concerns expressed here I also urge that other editors who have sullied the conversation with strident and excessive rhetoric refrain from doing so the next time a contentious RfA comes along

153,2108,1,8,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Was a bit conflicted on this but as per GwenChan I see a fair bit of indication that this user will not become a tyrant-with-a-block-button My concerns about deletion were partially ameliorated by some of the diffs the candidate provided as per WereSpielCheckers I don't read the "X is more important than Y" diffs the same way some other editors do in context but I certainly understand and sympathize with why those comments are problematic for many editors To balance out these negatives the candidate appears to be a serious force for good here in vandal fighting you can't "build an encyclopedia" when people are shooting holes in your construction faster than you can build I'm also glad that the candidate recognizes the problems with the bundling all admin rights not only through his words but through his actions working on a vandal fighting mini-admin proposal In the end I always ask "Do I think I can trust this editor?" My answer is "yes"

1008,1494,1,3,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,I think you should have done this before the AUSC appointments because now the community is put in the strange position of either throwing sand in ArbCom's face and having a CU without a block button among other strange things about a non-admin functionary or making you an admin However I would have supported a month ago and you certainly haven't become less qualified in that time The fact that you have two sitting and highly esteemed arbs in the first ten supports and that I can't think of two editors I respect more than Dank and Courcelles eliminates any doubts I might have had

7136,3335,1,1,0,1,0,7,2,2,0,8,0,2,0,9,3,4,1,Regardless of the raw data presented in this nomination I legitimately thought s/he was an admin already and a good one
9044,5888,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,3,5,1,1,0,As I said when I nominated him last time he conducts himself well while reverting vandal after vandal and doesn't lose his cool He deserves to have the ability to revert vandalism faster and block them so that he can revert more vandals in a given time Yes most of his edits are vandalism fighting but he's good at it and fair in it I have faith in him that he will not abuse his admin tools and he can learn along the way the various other going-ons in the community if he chooses to later involve himself in areas other than vandalism

1093,7387,1,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,I see no reason that he will abuse the tools nor abuse the communities trust 
357,630,1,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,I think he would be an incredibly helpful admin and a huge net positive even if all he ever did was look at deleted pages and start to figure out how to detect copyvio better Having said that I think he'll be an asset with the bit in the vandal-fighting arenas too clearly he has extensive knowledge in that regard as well

This would take half a minute or longer if the admin wants to take the time to vet the changes would that be a bad thing? If he needs broader powers to test things can't he do his testing on his other two wikis?

Does the candidate understand the project policies and guidelines to a good enough standard is the candidate generally going to make the right decisions when using any additional rights they are given and are the candidate sensible enough to know if and when they are not yet familiar enough with a particular admin area so as to not take administrative actions & decisions there?

Well maybe he learned his lesson over time But if there is one lesson from the incident that should not have required any time to learn it should have been "don't share accounts" But then that is what seemed to happen on Simple even if no edits were made And there seemed to be less than truthfulness - or at least less than candidness again - when trying to get the ban overturned And then again during the 2009 RfA when some of these issues went undisclosed until other editors brought them up Perhaps as Steven writes in his disclosure he has matured and learned his lesson and we should be able to trust him now Perhaps But he was supposedly mature enough to become an admin even back in 2008 when a number of editors stated they were prepared to nominate him shortly And it seems like he had trouble learning his lessons from the incident And trust lost through lack of truthfulness as opposed to an honest mistake or error in judgment like the one that started the whole thing is much harder to regain even through the passage of time especially when the lack of candor and truthfulness has been repeated several times in the interim even if perhaps not recently The bottom line for me is that I saw

Also some of the votes on other RfAs I find myself disagreeing with enough to wonder if he gets the whole adminship thing Too much moral judging and editcountitis Perhaps in some future RfA after some more seasoning I would support Oppose

146,1121,1,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,I'm pretty sure he's not going to do anything problematic Now if he's been around here for eight years he'll know that before you jump headlong into some kind of action administrative or otherwise you do your homework So if he starts wanting to close AfDs or handle requests at RFPP or whatnot he will have to go and read up on the relevant policy But so long as he does that I'm okay with him becoming an admin In general I reject the idea that we can neatly categorise RfA candidates into "content creator" or whatever Everyone contributes to Wikipedia in their own way whether that's writing Featured Articles closing XfDs patrolling WikiGnome work whatever I try not to make judgments

Maybe But I don't see it that way When someone wants to work an area they have no experience they can potentially cause damage Further ANI should be the ending place that admins work not the start A brand new sysop should not start at ANI New sysops should start at RFPP UAA PROD and PERM Areas that are the least controversial What this boils down to is that I am not confident that Miniapolis is aware of their limits I'm sorryv/r -

I'm reluctant to give it to him as a result But this in itself isn't a reason to oppose so I decided to read the questions And wow what I saw surprised me Questions 6 and 7 conflict themselves you say that you primarily contribute articles and would rather do that instead of admin work yet you say that primarily article writers shouldn't be admins? Very confusing All this would probably knock me down to a neutral though But after reading what you did with that one AfD that kinda takes the cake If an admin were to make that close with that decision it would've been awfully iffy in itself For a user to close it is basically going against the policy - we trust admins to close them over editors for a reason That and I disagree with the rationale of your decision it seems like you let your beliefs get in the way If the article is documentwrite'crap' why not eete it and let it get a fresh start?

11,1150,-1,9,8,2,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Sorry for being the first Oppose but I'm sadly unimpressed with the answers given to questions 2 and 3 I feel that someone having some knowledge in article work is a must for every RFA candidate with a few exceptions which I don't see one here Article work along with some AFD knowledge helps your skills with the proper Wikipedia policies and guidelines in order to be aware of how Wikipedia works as a whole It can help show the difference between a sneaky vandal edit and a non vandalism newbie edit or if the subject of a csd A7 notability tag technically meets the criteria to speedy delete or not Question 3 shows your dispute resolution skills and the answer "I haven't had conflicts and hopefully never will" won't work as an administrator Conflict is much of a given as a administrator of Wikipedia even if you only focus on CSDs and vandal work You will come to conflict with the article creators who is unclear why their article was deleted and be very persistent to find out You will have administrators questioning some of your speedy deletions or borderline blocks and so forth You do some amazing work in CSD but I can't support based on those answers Sorry

217,147,1,Thanks for being willing to help out with admin duties Good luck! 
217,279,1,Seems a bit green but I don't see that as a reason to oppose or not support here Decent spread of edits around the namespaces their attitude is great and I like their answers to the questions Good luck! ~

217,1205,-1,Calabe is almost completely lacking in content creation and inexperienced in the research writing and revising process Admins need to first learn the process of consensus building source checking and editing a page ideally to FA status Also per Secret's oppose above the [[Skillet band]] article he mentioned as being proud of is an awful mess which shows me that he cannot tell the difference between a high quality article and a low quality one How will be be able to make proper determinations on deletions based on his idea of an article to be proud of?

Q5's answer makes no sense whatsoever!

A simple spell-checker will help you here if your spelling isn't up to scratch - nothing to be ashamed of! The rather long history of flip-flopping between usernames accounts adminship and so on doesn't give me much confidence I understand that you were harassed but you took it very poorly indeed I can't understand why you'd want to risk yourself again particularly with your illness You even say in your Q1 answer you don't intend to do much work as an admin Well I think that in a case like yours there ought to be a more compelling reason for you to get the tools back Because frankly I think remaining an ordinary editor is in your best interests

The admin side can be extremely busy sometimes especially if there's not many of us online Plus if you're bored of the encyclopedia what's to say that once you've mastered the admin tools you won't become bored of them too? Thirdly in an RFA you'd ideally have to show evidence of how you've coped when coming into conflict with another editor as it then shows us how you interact with others and how you would deal with conflict I'd suggest trying again in another 6 months or so and hopefully it'll be third time lucky

I mean don't we already have evidence of how you'll behave in stressful situations?

4330,3870,-1,23,3,1,0,3,0,1,1,2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,I think that making Werdna an administrator will result in a net loss for his productivity and his enjoyment of Wikipedia which would be a shame as his technical work is excellent and is well publicised In my experience however his interactions with other Wikipedians have not been of a satisfactory level and aside from the confrontations he has twice taken wikibreaks of a month's duration due to choosing wrong disputes to weigh into "biting off more than he can chew" and getting himself upset Aside from what affect it may have had on others it has also had a bad effect on him When you become an admin one will get perhaps a five-fold increase in talk page messages and potential sticky situations to get into and I feel that this would damage Werdna's productivity even more especially in the technical depeartment where there is obviously a lesser supply of human resources and to which he has made many contributions such as the cascading protection that earned recognition in the Signpost I should note that this opposition is not meant to be a slight on an RfA candidate since there are also some excellent article writers with 400+ articles etc etc that I gave barnstars to but are extremely emotional and unsuited to the role and I would not support them either

Personally I have my preferences set to not allow an edit without a summary if I'm doing a chain of edits then I use a suitable summary for all - then after the first edit just by just typing the first letter firefox will fill in the rest with a click of the mouse

1159,1150,-1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,Sadly I must oppose because of a dearth of experience in content development and interaction with other contributors SwisterTwister's contributions are valuable but tagging pages cleaning them up and providing canned user-space comments alone are not going to give the experience necessary for adminship This is borne out in his/her answers to the questions above that don't demonstrate a depth of understanding or appreciation of policy that are necessary IMO Answers to the questions of DoriSmith and Salvio giuliano in particular trouble me Like others have said however don't lose heart! If you really want it I think you have the bones of a good admin in you You just need more content development experience and experience of user interaction will come with that I can tell you!

824,5509,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,I was fairly emphatic in my support for you last time based on a long history of demonstrated good judgement hard work and valuable contributions I still feel that way I looked over the dif provided in the oppose section regarding IRC and don't see the problem Taking things off-wiki to avoid situations that will just cause wiki-drama doesn't strike me as a big deal and indeed she could have had that conversation via email or telephone and we'd have no clue It also strikes me that fighting to protect a category isn't exactly egregious behavior and the fact that the dif provided precedes your last RfA makes it rather irrelevant 
7402,7401,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,because we need more people like him handling the tasks that need to be done to keep Wikipedia clean

440,944,-1,3,0,1,0,3,1,1,1,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,reluctantly I echo some of the concerns above although with a slightly different light - these concerns being that Logan a has not shown himself to have good judgement in this field and b that he has shown himself to be overeager and perhaps inclined to jump in without preparation As Jorgenev has said most of Logan's AfD related contributions - that is contributions to a field he wishes to work in by his own admission - are Non-Admin Closures NACs This is an important job which keeps backlogs down ensures the regular and steady flow of currency edits and is generally A Good Thing and I applaud Logan for the very admin-like attitude of being willing to get his hands dirty The bigger problem is that this means he's got no way of showing that he has good judgement in this field NACs are by definition those AfDs where the decision made is "there is no decision made" Logan's counter-argument doesn't actually address that point instead providing an excuse for why he can't show he's got good judgement However it's a bit cruel to hold a standard of "he must positively prove he's got good judgment" which is where my second point exacerbates the issues with his actions to summarise he has a habit of jumping into things without heeding the advice of others As an example this RfA Logan has spent the past few months somewhere between 3 and 6 pestering me to nominate him for RfA I reviewed his contributions and one of the concerns I cane up with is "you need to actually contribute to more AfDs so we can see evidence of your judgment" As we can see he didn't heed that advice instead he decided to simply go it alone without the support of me or anyone else His statement that he was "reluctant to be considered for the job" is a blatant falsehood give that he's spent between a quarter and a half of the year asking others to support him in this endeavour Despite this when the support failed to materialise he went ahead Together with the AfD actions this strikes me as the actions of someone with a tendency to jump into a mess when he feels he's ready for it regardless of what other people are saying and that kind of gung-ho attitude is only useful in an administrator someone who has the implicit support of the community for his judgement and is not at all useful in a candidate who has to prove that judgement in front of the editing community

No but just being trustworthy is a general trait needed in one Now why am I bringing up something about an incident on IRC when my own personal opinion is that IRC is not Wikipedia?

Usually candidates with edits less than 2000 are quickly SNOWed Where is the "ample experience of AfDs and other WP namespace tasks and adequate awareness of policy"? I don't consider 156 WP edits "ample" or "adequate" and most of the AfDs I looked at were "per nom" or "per X" rather than unique application of policy Messedrocker states the candidate "has been editing Wikipedia since September 2005" yet ignores that during 14 of those 16-17 months Somitho made a grand total of fifteen edits I really dislike seeing people who don't meet basic community standards for RfA nominated for adminship It doesn't seem fair on the candidate to set them up like that Also with regard to the candidate's response to Lost
