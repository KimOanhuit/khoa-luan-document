300.0,68.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,the opposes concerning automated or the percentage of automated edits are unconvincing as i see nothing wrong in using tools to help maintain the encyclopedia ronhjones is an experienced user and i see no indication that he will misuse the tools
104.0,605.0,-1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,17.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,certainly a very civil editor and with a heart in the right place but malleus mkativerata and fastily have said the essential does not meet any of

3094.0,3910.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,i am concerned about the answer to q4 copyright violations and attack pages do not deserve consideration these types of articles are a liability and the hangon tag need not stop the clock great edits and great editor it is not even matter of memorizing policy just a few glances should improve your answers
3087.0,2287.0,-1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,from the uaa diff that wisdom has already cited i fear that matthewedwards would be too loose with the block button i talked to him about those reports and although he was nice enough in his response i am not impressed by his explanation that he wanted to block

274.0,322.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,seems like a good editor i think most of the opposes are reading to deeply into the responses looking for a reason to oppose rather than a reason to support
10191.0,10068.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,like so many others on this page had no idea he wasn t an admin already

413.0,4596.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,no hesitation

388.0,2108.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,has contributed more content than i have or ever will i guess i am a bad admin

239.0,322.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,per risker no concerns

2187.0,85.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,no problems here would be a great admin

901.0,2409.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,great editor who will be an asset to the project the one single oppose is not convincing quite the opposite if the only fault you can find is that the candidate argued in a discussion in a way that you disagree with then the candidate really will make a good admin a good adminship candidate needs to be clueful civil helpful able to articulate their thoughts and explain their actions but they do not have to share your philosophy or views regards

1122.0,5301.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,good vandal fighter plenty of edits meets my 2k minimum very civil give this man a mop

752.0,804.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,kinda redundant to be saying support in a section called support but i digress interacted with them on the ethical oil

901.0,316.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,had this rfa pre watchlisted and since i cannot find any faults in the candidate is contributions i probably did so because i really think he should be an admin regards

4283.0,2187.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,22.0,0.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,i have not talked to him but i have seen his editing here and there on wikipedia and i am sure he will make a great admin yay indians okay i am done now

6727.0,2683.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,excellent candidate that will help out a lot

206.0,2377.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,seems to be a good editor and good candidate for admin
